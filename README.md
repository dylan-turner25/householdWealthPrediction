# householdWealthPrediction
using data from the survey of consumer finance to identify non-invasive survey questions that can be used to predict household wealth

## Objective
Many economic theories of individual decision making rely on individual wealth as an input. This is a difficult piece of information to obtain. Even when survey's are invoked, survey respondent's are often unwilling to disclose household net worth. Additionally, households may not precisely know their own networth or may calculate it differently (for example some respondent's may include home equity where as other may not). The purpose of this project is to use the detailed survey data from the survey of consumer finance to train a machine learning model to predict household wealth based on other individual characteristics. The hope is to identify a set of individual characteristics that are non-invasive and can be used to predicted household wealth with reasonable accuracy. These characteristics can be included in future surveys to elicit household wealth in an indirect way which may be an improvement over directly asking for such information.

## Data
Specific years and variables can be extracted from the survey of consumer finance here: https://sda.berkeley.edu/sdaweb/analysis/?dataset=scfcomb 
This is much easier than downloading the entire dataset and sifting through the codebook to obtain the desired variables.
